sas_temper

structurefactor.py - a class that specifies a structure factor for a 
                     model.  A YAML configuration file for sas_temper
                     can also be used to specify that a model be multiplied
                     by a structure factor.  In a sasmodels, a structure 
                     factor is just another form of model for the purpose of
                     the calculation.  Once calculated, sas_temper multiplies
                     F(q)*S(q) for I(q) to compare against the data.
