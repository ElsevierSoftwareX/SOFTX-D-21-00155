param.py - model parameters for the simulated annlealing to be
            performed by sas_temper.  The parameters are
            taken from a configuration file provided in the defined
            and parsed using code from this project.  After reading 
            in a configuration file in the format defined as part 
            of the Expert LDRD and extract the information required 
            to define a model as implemented in the sasmodels codebase 
            used in SASView and bumps.  SASMoodels require a name and 
            a set of model-specific parameters to call the correct 
            code to generate an intensity profile. By a parameter, we 
            mean a variable from a model, such as a radius or scattering 
            length density, which fall under a model name given by the 
            "Name" keyword.  The structure factors that exist in SASModels 
            also have parameter sets and the object will be reused there.
